\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:relw}
In this paper we are building on a regression model for touch prediction based on smartphones' inertial measurement units. 
We therefore structured our related work in the following parts: (1) existing solutions and research about touch prediction, and (2) \textbf{who the hell knows}.
