	We recorded a total of X minutes of sensor data from the \textit{touch} and \textit{Fitt's Law task} task. Since we are only interested in sensor changes during the process of reaching for a target and touching it and the purpose of the \textit{Fitt's Law task} was only for reseting the participants grip to the lower half of the phone our first step in our preprocessing pipeline was \texttt{cutting} out the sensor fragments of the \textit{Fitt's Law task}.
