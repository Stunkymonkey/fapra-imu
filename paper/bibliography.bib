abstract = {Touchscreens are the most successful input method for smartphones. Despite their flexibility, touch input is limited to the location of taps and gestures. We present PalmTouch, an additional input modality that differentiates between touches of fingers and the palm. Touching the display with the palm can be a natural gesture since moving the thumb towards the device's top edge implicitly places the palm on the touchscreen. We present different use cases for PalmTouch, including the use as a shortcut and for improving reachability. To evaluate these use cases, we have developed a model that differentiates between finger and palm touch with an accuracy of 99.53% in realistic scenarios. Results of the evaluation show that participants perceive the input modality as intuitive and natural to perform. Moreover, they appreciate PalmTouch as an easy and fast solution to address the reachability issue during one-handed smartphone interaction compared to thumb stretching or grip changes.},

abstract = {SubTAG of the Department of Defense Human Factors Engineering Technical Advisory Group (DoD HFE TAG). This booklet is a digest of material appearing in MIL-STD-1472, and is complemented with material from MIL-HDBK-759 and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Human Factors Design Guide. The user is therefore referred to those documents and its references for required supplementary information. This digest provides basic, quantitative human engineering design data in pictorial, tabular, and graphical formats for use during system, equipment, or facility design and assessment. Its purpose is to furnish a convenient “portable” reference of human engineering design criteria and guidelines. The principles, explanations, limitations, and application techniques associated with the data have been intentionally omitted. This abbreviated presentation presupposes that the user is familiar with the bases and limitations of the given data or will consult applicable references to ensure appropriate application of the data.},
