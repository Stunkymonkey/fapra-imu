\section{Discussion}
Disuses why it is still not awesome and how this could be improved. Why this is still awesome? Think about: Nobody has done this before. 

\subsection*{Limitations}
In this paper we focused on one specific use task where users touched randomized targets on smartphones while sitting in on a chair without armrests. 
The sensor samples generated during our study are specific for this use case and thereby do not cover ordinary smartphone usage and implied phone movement when for example walking or operating the phone in a train.
