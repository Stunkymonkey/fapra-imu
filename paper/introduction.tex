\section{Introduction}
Touch is the preferred input method on smartphones today. 
Current research and manufacturers are constantly trying to improve and enhance the interaction on smartphones. 
One way can be the extension of interactable space with interaction possibilities on the devices' backside \cite{Yoo,Le2016,Baudisch2009,Le2017}.
However, some of these solutions do not conform with the form factors and weights of ordinary phones \cite{Corsten2017,DeLuca2013,Shen,Wolf2012}.
Another way to extend interaction is the introduction of additional touch gestures on the touchscreen \cite{Le:2018:PalmTouch}.


In this paper we present a machine learning model for predicting touches on smartphones using only the phones' built-in sensors.
